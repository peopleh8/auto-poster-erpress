let exampleArticle = 'The pace fell significantly short of expectations on Wall Street. Economists had forecast new-home sales to total 688,000 in November. New-home sales are at the lowest level since November 2022. The rate of new-home sales was dragged down by sharp drops in the South and the West. The data from October was revised. New-home sales fell a revised 4% in October, compared with the initial estimate of a 5.6% drop. The new-home sales data are volatile month over month and are often revised. Key details: The median sales price of a new home sold in November rose to $434,700 from $414,900 in the prior the month. The supply of new homes for sale rose 16.5% between October and November, equating to a 9.2-month supply. Half of the nation reported an increase in new-home sales, with the Midwest posting the biggest gains at 25%, followed by the Northeast at 3.1%. Sales fell in the South by 20.9% and in the West by 5.1%. Overall, sales of new homes are up 1.4% compared with last year. Big picture: Housing data can be noisy, so this month‚Äôs fall in new-home sales may be an aberration. That won‚Äôt be known until a trend develops. Aside from the bleak number, the U.S. housing market is overall showing early signs of a recovery as mortgage rates fall significantly in December and home-buying demand ticks up. And rates are poised to fall further, based on economists‚Äô estimates. With a lack of resale inventory persisting, home builders are in a strong position to meet increasing buyer demand‚Äîand they‚Äôre responding. Housing starts jumped 15% in November, a sign that builders are ramping up construction on new housing units. What are they saying? ‚ÄúThe significant decline in new-home sales in the largest region of the country, the South, drove this month‚Äôs new-home sales report into negative territory,‚Äù analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note. ‚ÄúThis was the largest month-over-month decline since April of 2022.‚Äù Market reaction: Stocks were up in early trading on Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was below 3.9%. Shares of builders, including D.R. Horton Inc., Lennar Corp., PulteGroup Inc. and Toll Brothers Inc. were up in the morning trading session.
